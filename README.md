# Mood based music player application
## INTRODUCTION
Music is an important component of our daily life.We listen to songs according to our mood.Music is one of the entertainment environments.
Music is a component that directs people's emotions and enables them to live their emotions intensely.
It is a comfort for people to live according to their instant feelings.Our feelings guide us in daily life.In a system where emotions are so important, such projects have a great 
place.It is important to play an appropriate song for a particular emotional state.The current music player meets the basic needs of the user, but the user has to face the task of
manually navigating the playlist of songs and selecting songs based on their current mood and behavior.Usually people have a lot of songs in their playlists.Therefore, most people
randomly select a song from the playlist and some songs may not be suitable for the user's current mood and may disappoint the user.As a result, some songs do not match the user's 
current feeling.Also, there is no widely used application that can play songs according to the current feelings of the user.Since music is an important entertainment tool for 
listeners, it plays a very important role in improving the life of the individual.This project is based on the principle of detecting the emotions of the users in order to play
the songs appropriate to the current emotional state.Users' instant emotional states can be observed with many techniques.In our study, we ask the users to choose between
6 emotions (joy, sadness, anger, excitement, rebelion, fear).In this way, the user can instantly choose which emotions the song is playing.After this election, he can see what
feelings the song contains.In this way, the user can choose a song based on his instant feeling.Our project aims to play music based on the current emotional state of the user.
"Android Studio" and "firebase Real-time database" were used for this project.
